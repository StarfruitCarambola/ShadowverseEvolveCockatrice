<h3> Making a Deck </h3>

- Cockatrice has two decks, the main deck and side deck. We will use the main deck for our main deck, and use the the side deck for our evolve deck. 
- To add cards to your main deck, search for the desired card and double click on it. To move the card to your evolve deck, double click on the card from the main deck.
- These steps are not required and completely optional. 
    - Add one Land card in the evolve deck to help keep track of used and unused play points. 
    - Add the tokens you need in the evolve deck for ease of access.  

Your deck should look like this:

<h3> Setting Up </h3>

- To start playing games on Cockatrice, you will need to an account. 
    - If you need to register an account, click on "Cockatrice" and "Register to server". Enter a player name, password, email, and click OK. Afterward, accept the verification email to verify your account. 
    - If you already have an account, click on "Cockatrice" and "Connect" to login. 
-  Once logged in, click on the "Server" tab and select "Other Games" to find other players to play *Shadowverse Evolve*. 
- Once you enter the room, click "Load deck" on the top left corner to select the deck you want to use and "Ready to start".

<h3> Playing the Game </h3>

- Right-click on "Sideboard" to open your Evolve deck and put down your leader.
- Right-click on "Roll the die" to see who goes first. 
- Notice the seven circles on the side. The player who goes second can left-click on one of the circles to mark down three evolution points. 
- Draw four cards by double clicking the deck. You can perform mulligans by highlighting every card, right clicking "Bottom to the deck in random order", and drawing four new cards.

- Now this is where the Land cards become helpful to keep track of play points. As you start your turn, right-click "Clone" on the Land card to make a copy. Tap the Land cards to spend play points. If you play Magic: the Gathering or Force of Will, this may seem similar as it is how they keep track of their play points. 
- On the top left, there is an "Untap" button which lets you untap all the cards on the field. It is an easy way to untap all your followers and refresh your play points.

- An useful feature is that you can hold right-click on a card to drag an arrow towards another card or target your opponent. Use this for target abilities or attacking. Right click on the arrow to remove it

- There are a lot of tokens in Evolve. Thus, the best way to use tokens is to put one copy in your evolve deck, place it on the field, and clone it when you need multiples. Alternatively, you can right-click "Create token" and type the token you need.

## Questions & Answers

<h3>Why is there a lot of manual input?</h3>

Playing manually does give many perks, especially when learning the game. Developing good card movement habits, memorizing turn/phase order, and needing to socially interact with your opponent are but a few advantages that manual sims offer that automated ones do not nearly as easily.

<h3>How often does the plugin update?</h3>

We will have the cards updated as quick as we can. Keep in mind that we are inputting the cards in the xml file manually as there is no API for *Shadowverse Evolve* card database. We will continuously maintain and update this plugin, completely free of charge and for the benefit of the community. If/when an update isn't coming as quickly as you want it, please be patient, life happens sometimes. 

<h3>I found an error in a card's text/name/etc in the database, how do I let you know about it?</h3>

Drop an ping to @skonx or @starfruit_ in the [Shadowverse Evolve server](https://discord.gg/shadowverse-evolve-tcg-community-928746294384677004) and give a clear explanation of the error. We may not respond immediately, but we do read every ping and all errors we get notified of. We acknowledge on our end that it will be fixed upon the next set of updates.
